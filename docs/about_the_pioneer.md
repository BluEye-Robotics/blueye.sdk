# About The Pioneer
The [`Blueye`](https://www.blueyerobotics.com/) Pioneer is a underwater drone for inspection. Here is a [`youtube video`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-AEtr6xOP8) presenting the drone.
If you can't commit to watching a youtube video, watch this gif of the Pioneer diving a deep water reef.
