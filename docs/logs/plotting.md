# Plotting
This example shows how one can pull a log file from the drone and use
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to plot
it.

=== "Binary logs"
    We'll start by downloading a log file from the drone

    ```python
    from blueye.sdk import Drone

    myDrone = Drone()
    log = myDrone.logs[0]
    ```

    Next we'll parse the log to a stream and create a pandas dataframe from the records. We'll also specify the column names to make it easier to work with the dataframe later.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import blueye.protocol as bp

    columns = ["rt", "delta", "meta", "message"]
    log_stream = log.parse_to_stream()
    divelog = pd.DataFrame.from_records(log_stream, columns=columns)
    ```

    We'll now filter out all entries that are not depth telemetry messages and messages that were logged before the start of the dive.

    ```python
    depth_log = divelog[divelog.meta == bp.DepthTel]
    depth_log = depth_log[depth_log.rt > log.start_time]
    ```

    We can now extract the depth value from the remaining entries

    ```python
    depth_log["depth"] = depth_log["message"].apply(lambda x: x.depth.value)
    ```

    We'll prepare our axes for plotting

    ```python
    x = depth_log["rt"]
    y = depth_log["depth"]
    ```

=== "Legacy Logs"
    We'll start by downloading a log file from the drone

    ```python
    from blueye.sdk import Drone

    myDrone = Drone()
    myDrone.legacy_logs[0].download(output_name="log0.csv")
    ```

    We can now read the csv-file into a pandas object for easy manipulation

    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    divelog = pd.read_csv("log0.csv")
    ```

    and then we'll convert the unix timestamp in `rt_clock` into a more readable format:

    ```python
    divelog["rt_clock"] = pandas.to_datetime(divelog["rt_clock"], unit="s")
    ```

    We'll prepare our axes for plotting

    ```python
    x = divelog["rt_clock"]
    y = divelog["depth"] / 1000  # Dividing by 1000 to get depth in meters
    ```

Next we will plot depth vs time with matplotlib:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Instantiate our figure and axes to plot on
figure, axes = plt.subplots()

# Plot the depth values against time
axes.plot(x, y, label="depth")

# Set title, labels, and legend
plt.title("Depth chart")
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel("Depth [m]")
plt.legend()

# Save the figure
figure.savefig("depth_plot.svg")
```

This should yield us a plot that looks something like this:
![plot](../media/depth_plot.svg)

See the [matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html) for more ways
to plot your data.
