## Installation
The SDK requires Python 3.10 or higher. We recommend using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage your Python versions and virtual environments. `uv` is an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver that simplifies project setup.

The instructions below show the necessary steps to get started with the SDK on a fresh install using `uv`.

??? abstract "Windows"
    **Install `uv`**

    Open PowerShell and run the following command to install `uv`:
    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```
    Changing the execution policy allows running a script from the internet.
    You may need to restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.

    **Create a virtual environment**

    Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to isolate project dependencies.
    ```powershell
    # Create a new project folder and navigate into it
    mkdir drone_project
    cd .\drone_project

    # Create a virtual environment using Python 3.13 (uv will download it if needed)
    uv venv -p 3.13
    ```
    This will create a `.venv` folder in your project directory.

    Activate the virtual environment:
    ```powershell
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    **Install the SDK**

    Now we're ready to install the SDK into our active virtual environment:

    ```shell
    uv pip install blueye.sdk
    ```

    Or, to include the dependencies required for running the examples:

    ```shell
    uv pip install "blueye.sdk[examples]"
    ```

??? abstract "macOS and Linux"

    **Install `uv`**

    Open your terminal and run the following command to install `uv`:
    ```shell
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```
    After installation, follow the instructions on the screen to add `uv` to your shell's `PATH`, or simply restart your terminal.

    **Create a virtual environment**

    Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to isolate project dependencies.
    ```shell
    # Create a new project folder and navigate into it
    mkdir drone_project
    cd drone_project

    # Create a virtual environment using Python 3.13 (uv will download it if needed)
    uv venv -p 3.13
    ```
    This will create a `.venv` folder in your project directory.

    Activate the virtual environment:
    ```shell
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    **Install the SDK**

    Now we're ready to install the SDK into our active virtual environment:

    ```shell
    uv pip install blueye.sdk
    ```

    Or, to include the dependencies required for running the examples:

    ```shell
    uv pip install "blueye.sdk[examples]"
    ```

## Connect to the drone
To use the SDK, your computer must be connected to the drone via the surface unit WiFi. For instructions
on how to turn on the drone and surface unit, you can watch the
[quick start video](https://support.blueye.no/hc/en-us/articles/360006901473-Quick-Start-Guide).

## Control the drone
Most of the functionality is controlled using Python properties. We will illustrate the use of
properties by showing how to control the lights:

``` python
import time
from blueye.sdk import Drone

# When the Drone object is instantiated, a connection to the drone is established
myDrone = Drone()

# Setting the lights property to 0.1 (10 %)
myDrone.lights = 0.1

time.sleep(2)

# We can also get the current brightness of the lights through the lights property
print(f"Current light intensity: {myDrone.lights}")
myDrone.lights = 0

# Properties can also be used for reading telemetry data from the drone
print(f"Current depth in meters: {myDrone.depth}")
```
For an overview of the properties that are available for controlling and reading data from the drone, go to the
[`Reference section`](reference/blueye/sdk/drone.md) of the documentation.
The valid input ranges and descriptions of the different properties can also be found there.


!!! Tip
    You can explore the properties of the drone interactively using an interactive Python interpreter like
    [`iPython`](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/tutorial.html), which can be installed with:
    ```shell
    uv pip install ipython
    ```
    By instantiating a Drone object and using the completion key (normally the `tab-key â†¹`), you can get an interactive list of
    the available properties on the drone, making it easy to try setting and getting the different properties.

### Watching the video stream
The easiest way to open the RTSP video stream is by using [`VLC media player`](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html).
Once VLC is downloaded, you can start the stream like this. The RTSP URL is: `rtsp://192.168.1.101:8554/test`
![text](https://blueyenostorage.blob.core.windows.net/sdkimages/rtsp-in-vlc.gif)


For lower latency streaming (on a PC), you can see the instructions on using
[`Gstreamer`](video/gstreamer-for-video-streaming.md), or if you just want to watch a low-latency
stream, you can download the Blueye Observer app.
([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blueye-dive-buddy/id1453884806?ls=1) /
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.blueye.divebuddy))

The normal Blueye app cannot be used to spectate when controlling the drone from the SDK because
it will interfere with the commands sent from the SDK. The Observer app, however, is only a
spectator and can be used together with the SDK.

### Explore the examples
For further examples on how to use the SDK to control the drone have a look at the
[motion examples](movement/from-the-CLI.md).

Remember to install the example dependencies before running the examples.

```shell
uv pip install "blueye.sdk[examples]"
```

### Local documentation
Since the drone surface unit (usually) does not have internet access it can be a bit tricky to
reference this documentation while developing on the drone. Luckily when you install the SDK from
PyPI it includes a pre-built, local copy of this documentation. This documentation can be viewed by
executing the following Python snippet:

```python
import blueye.sdk

blueye.sdk.open_local_documentation()
```
